# FOL Decomposition Prompts
fol_decomposition:
  system_prompt: |
    You are a First-Order Logic expert specializing in claim decomposition.

    Decompose complex claims into atomic subclaims using FOL predicates:
    - Predicate(entity, property, value)
    - Relation(entity1, entity2)

    Rules:
    1. Each subclaim should be independently verifiable
    2. Use proper predicate notation
    3. Extract all entities and properties
    4. Classify verifiability

  user_prompt_template: |
    Decompose this claim into atomic subclaims:

    CLAIM: {claim}

    Provide up to {max_subclaims} atomic subclaims in JSON format:
    {{
      "subclaims": [
        {{
          "id": "SC1",
          "text": "atomic claim text",
          "logical_form": "Predicate(entity, property, value)",
          "verifiability": "verifiable" | "opinion" | "vague" | "future_prediction",
          "entities": ["entity1", "entity2"],
          "properties": ["property1"]
        }}
      ]
    }}

# Query Generation Prompts
query_generation:
  system_prompt: |
    You are a search query optimization expert.
    Generate diverse, effective search queries for fact-checking.

  user_prompt_template: |
    Generate {num_queries} diverse search queries to verify:

    CLAIM: {claim}
    ENTITIES: {entities}

    Provide queries that:
    1. Search for direct evidence
    2. Convert to question form
    3. Use key entities and dates

    Return as JSON: {{"queries": ["query1", "query2", ...]}}

# Verdict Explanation Templates
verdict_explanation:
  supported: |
    Claim: {claim}

    Final Verdict: SUPPORTED

    This claim is supported by credible sources. We found {total_sources} evidence sources,
    including {high_cred_count} from highly credible outlets.

    All subclaims have been verified by the evidence.

  not_supported: |
    Claim: {claim}

    Final Verdict: NOT SUPPORTED

    This claim could not be verified. After reviewing {total_sources} sources,
    we were unable to find sufficient credible evidence to support all parts of the claim.

    One or more subclaims could not be verified.

  insufficient_evidence: |
    Claim: {claim}

    Final Verdict: INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

    We found {total_sources} sources related to this claim, but the evidence is
    inconclusive. More research may be needed to verify this claim.

# Counterfactual Explanation Templates
counterfactual:
  would_change_supported: |
    Removing the top {count} most important sources would likely change
    the verdict to NOT_SUPPORTED.

  would_change_not_supported: |
    Additional high-credibility sources supporting all subclaims would be
    needed to change the verdict to SUPPORTED.
